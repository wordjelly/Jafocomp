// what to index?
// for the prefixes => each and every word, including the stop words
// for the contexts
// wordgrams, 
// buy 
// buy oil
// buy oil in 
// buy oil in april
// oil
// oil in
// oil in april
// and other combinations of the words that can be made
// while searching
// to get the context ->> take all the words before the last word, and search the contexts of the prexisting query for the smallest length context that matches it, send that as the context.
// prefix is the last word.
// other option is to send the context as just that previous string.
// we can send both, with a higher weightage for this one.

1. up_down - DONE
2. standard deviation days - the superscript issue.
-----------------------------------------------------------
8th november
------------
3. sma_cross - summarizing this - okay here we have a small problem.(we change the way the indicator is named -> simple moving averages cross (3 -> 17)) -> on click it should transform ? so let us see how it looks, also the charting options.(this is pending.)
4. remove see-more - DONE
5. d3 charts -> sharable(this is pending)
6. underline or tags for the names of the entities
--> so we have a smaller description line below, and that same line is shown in the thing below.
so in the main thing will read only moving averages cross.
what about the charts ?

** this has to finish today.

-----------------------------------------------------------
9th november
------------
7. proximity and rescoring search
8. adding icons for calendar events/for the stocks themselves.
9. description of the subindicator can be given below, as well as the indicator
-----------------------------------------------------------
10th november
-------------
10.notable points simple english summary.
11. checking the calculation accuracy.
-----------------------------------------------------------

if you want it to work, that is what it will take.
=============================================================
no more features beyond this will be implemented.
current progress is approximately 3 features per day.
based on that timeline, this project should be completed by sunday evening, come what may.
after that we design google ads for one week, or take the decision for climate data -> for the wow factor (max one week => actually both)
=============================================================

# just make it a superscript, you can't solve it all.

--> i think i am within 1 week of getting this done -> maybe if i can manage the d3 and icons, part, then i can leave the proximity scoring for the end -> and that will be the end of all things, and then the checking why all the calculations are wrong.

9. calling it a day.

after this we go for better sorting. 
that will be the end of it.
by this weekend i think this project stage one will be completed.

## these three are the main things.


3.nifty 50 monday -> gives the first two as the closest mondays, but is not giving simple monday -> directly jumps to further shit - this is again about weightage and proximity and nothing more.


6.nifty bank index sets a 3 day high, in 2016 there are only 3 incidences ?



8. for time based -> more weightage for nearness
9. for correlation -> more weightage for profit.


calendar symbol
better presentation for the time data -> need nice charts from d3.
checking the calculation accuracy.
i want to cover this on sunday i.e tomorrow -> i want to finish.
