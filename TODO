// what to index?
// for the prefixes => each and every word, including the stop words
// for the contexts
// wordgrams, 
// buy 
// buy oil
// buy oil in 
// buy oil in april
// oil
// oil in
// oil in april
// and other combinations of the words that can be made
// while searching
// to get the context ->> take all the words before the last word, and search the contexts of the prexisting query for the smallest length context that matches it, send that as the context.
// prefix is the last word.
// other option is to send the context as just that previous string.
// we can send both, with a higher weightage for the primary context.
