// what to index?
// for the prefixes => each and every word, including the stop words
// for the contexts
// wordgrams, 
// buy 
// buy oil
// buy oil in 
// buy oil in april
// oil
// oil in
// oil in april
// and other combinations of the words that can be made
// while searching
// to get the context ->> take all the words before the last word, and search the contexts of the prexisting query for the smallest length context that matches it, send that as the context.
// prefix is the last word.
// other option is to send the context as just that previous string.
// we can send both, with a higher weightage for this one.

//  buy gold when oil's aroon_up first trading day of the week (21 Jan 2019)

// there is no role for the indicator here , also text formulation is incorrect.

// least profitable trade is showing zero everywhere.

// --------------------------------------------

// for multi word stuff -> we have to split on the underscores.
// gotta sort all that out, also the different things being truncated.
// so for sma -> we will use (shows a moving average divergence)
// shortening of the sma cross and such things, and close
// the defaults -> to show a new user
// and fixing the search queries.
// showing close falls -> defaulting to that.
// fixing the profit and loss explanations
// if there are multiple sma cross types, then 
// like 4 day sma crosses above 12 day sma
// 22 day sma crosses above 12 day sma.

---------------------------------------------------------------
// hook the positive and negative counts using profit and loss
// do the t-test for complexes and indicators.
// sort by that, and gauss of the epoch.
// add chart js to show the yearly trends for the indicator.
// and then market that bitch.
